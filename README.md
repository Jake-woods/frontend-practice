# Frontend practice
This repository is for me to store my frontend skills (HTML,CSS,JS, Frameworks) projects. 




None of these websites are designs created by myself, they are templates which I have to used to practice my skills. Please find the links below to the websites that provided the templates.

Links to templating websites: [W3Layouts](https://w3layouts.com/), [Templated](https://templated.co/)
